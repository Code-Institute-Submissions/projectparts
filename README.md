## UX

Project parts is a competition website for car enthusiasts who wish to play for the more expensive car modification parts. The target audience is the car modification community.

The site will offer 'tickets' at a fraction of the cost of the full product price. Each competition will have a set amount of tickets before the competition ends and an winner is drawn randomly. All enterants must get the question correct in-order to be entered into a competition.

- A User will want to create a profile so that they can see previously entered competitions and there winner.

- A User will want to search on modifications by either categories or the car model they fit.

- A User will want a payment system in-order to pay for the tickets they wish to play.

- A User will want to be able to see the price of the full product as if they were to buy it compared to the ticket price.

- A User will want to be able to quick add set amount of tickets.

- Users will want to be able to read more about each product on there own page with more description.

- User will want a cart that tickets can be added to and updated with the amount. A cart will display the tick price, quantity and the full total.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Forms, URLs and models for each application with the project have been test using automated tests. You can run these tests with `python manage.py test` or if you wish to run a specific applications test type `python manage.py test *application_name*`.
